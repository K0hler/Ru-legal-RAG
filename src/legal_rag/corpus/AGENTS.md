# Corpus compilation module

Scope: extraction, cleanup, legal structure, canonical entities, review gates, and corpus builds.

- `LegalAct` is stable identity; `LegalEdition` is a specific verified snapshot; `LegalProvision` belongs to exactly one edition.
- Preserve offsets and provenance through every transformation. Account for all source text as parsed, unresolved, or explicitly excluded.
- Build `ActIdentity` before the Legal AST. Uncertain structure becomes `unresolved_block`; never invent a provision.
- Keep `captured_at`, declared revision date, and verified `valid_from`/`valid_to` separate. Unknown coverage stays unknown.
- IDs and hashes must be deterministic for the same inputs and tool versions.
- Approved canonical data is immutable within a `CorpusBuild`; activate a new build only after its gates pass.
