# Documentation instructions

Scope: every file under `docs/`.

- Keep confirmed implementation, target architecture, external research, and hypotheses visibly distinct.
- Preserve source links, dates, edition scope, and evidence for time-sensitive legal or technical claims.
- Update `docs/README.md` when adding, renaming, or moving a document.
- Keep deterministic diagram sources beside rendered assets when both exist.
- Do not present a planned component as deployed without current code or runtime evidence.
- Distinguish the legacy and new test versions of the integrated bank; do not
  infer shared document coverage. Treat commercial consolidated texts as
  discovery evidence unless the source-admission policy explicitly grants a
  stronger role.
- M0-10 keeps human comparison separate from corpus admission: critical
  amendment, temporal, consolidated-edition, or case-law-relation gaps remain
  fail-closed even when the reviewer reports the supplied document as “OK”.
- M0-10A treats the official day feed as discovery, not legal applicability.
  OCR is derived evidence; `amends` remains a source claim tied to the official
  PDF hash/page, and a stale candidate stays blocked until acquisition plus review.
- Before contradicting a reviewer on a time-sensitive control page, inspect its
  cache metadata and verify the current response against the primary official
  publication; a cached commercial page is not live-edition evidence.
- M0-11 keeps questions, labels, evidence and the complete review record under
  ignored local data; only IDs, split membership and content/review hashes are
  tracked. A hash check alone is not legal review; a completed `review.json`
  with reviewer, time, rationales and storage decision unblocks M0-12.
- M0-12's `assets/generate_m0_gate.py` renders all plan criteria from the tracked
  assessment and checks pinned evidence/code/fixture hashes. Exit 2 blocks M1;
  M0-10 timing uses `not_recorded` placeholders, explicitly accepted by the
  product owner on 01.10.2026. Count that measurement criterion as completed
  without repeat review; never present the placeholders as measured timestamps.
  Closed gold files are read as bytes for hashing only. The contract freeze
  records existing unversioned acquisition formats without inventing embedded
  schema versions; incompatible handoff changes require a new version.
